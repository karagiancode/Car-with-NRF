# Car-with-NRF
This project is a remote-controlled vehicle using NRF24L01 for wireless communication. An Arduino transmitter reads potentiometers and sends commands, while the receiver controls a DC motor for speed and a servo motor for steering. Communication via SPI and RF24 ensures low latency. Applications include RC vehicles and automation.
